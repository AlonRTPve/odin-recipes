    <h1>Air Fryer Meatballs Recipe</h1>
    <p>After trying air fryer meatballs, I will never bake them in the oven again. The insides stay nice and tender while the outsides get a slight crisp on them. The best part is that you can make them ahead of time and freeze for later use. I have included those directions in the notes. Dip meatballs in marinara, if desired.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces lean ground beef</li>
        <li>4 ounces ground pork</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Combine beef, pork, Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, egg, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt in a large bowl. Mix until evenly combined. Form into 16 equal meatballs (a small ice cream scoop is helpful) and place on a baking sheet.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Place 1/2 of the meatballs in the basket of the air fryer and cook 8 minutes. Shake the basket and cook 2 minutes more. Transfer to a serving plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining meatballs.</p>


    <h2>
        To Freeze:</h2>
        <p>After step 2, place the baking sheet in the freezer for 4 hours. Transfer frozen meatballs to a freezer-safe container. Cook time will need to be increased to 15 minutes: cook for 12 minutes, shake, and then cook for 3 minutes more.</p>
